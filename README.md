# StarWarsFanApp

Project develop for OpenWebTechnology by Pedro Andres Blanco

## Getting Started

Created for Web-App Developer Challenge
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

### Instructions Provided

##### UC1

The user opens your app and gets a login screen. He has to login. After a successful login he is navigated to
the overview page (UC2).
(Bonus: If the user is logged in, he can refresh the browser and has not to login again)
(Note: To simplify this task, handle the authentication locally in your app and not consume any external
services like auth0)

##### UC2

The user has a list of all Star Wars resources, where he can filter for resource types (like people, starships...).

##### UC3

The list in UC2 should be extended. Add a search element, which searches anything in the any resource (fuzzy
search).

##### UC4

The user clicks on a resource item and gets a detail view over it.
